What is Supervised Learning?

In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels.

A typical supervised learning task is classification. The spam filter is a good example of this: it is trained with many example emails along with their  class(spam or ham), and it must learn how to classify new emails. 
Another typical task is to predict a  targetnumeric value, such as the price of a car, given a set of features(mileage, age, brand, etc.) called  predictors. 
This sort of task is called regression. To train the system, you need to give it many examples of cars, including both their predictors and their labels (i.e., their prices).

I will try to post my hand-on project regarding below algorithm, and I hope I can cover all of these algorithm and have a better understanding through project learning.

Below are the most popular and widely used supervised algprithm:

• k-Nearest Neighbors

• Linear Regression

• Logistic Regression

• Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

• Decision Trees and Random Forests

• Neural networks
